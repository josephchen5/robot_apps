# Keypoints descriptors/detectors

ORB/ScaleFactor: 1.2   #  default=1.2  Pyramid decimation ratio, greater than 1. scaleFactor==2 means the classical pyramid, where each next level has 4x less pixels than the previous, but such a big scale factor will degrade feature matching scores dramatically. On the other hand, too close to 1 scale factor will mean that to cover certain scale range you will need more pyramid levels and so the speed will suffer
ORB/NLevels: 8  # default= 8 The number of pyramid levels. The smallest level will have linear size equal to input_image_linear_size/pow(scaleFactor, nlevels
ORB/EdgeThreshold: 31  # default= 31 This is size of the border where the features are not detected. It should roughly match the patchSize parameter
ORB/FirstLevel: 0  # default= 0 It should be 0 in the current implementation
ORB/WTA_K: 2  # default= 2 The number of points that produce each element of the oriented BRIEF descriptor. The default value 2 means the BRIEF where we take a random point pair and compare their brightnesses, so we get 0/1 response. Other possible values are 3 and 4. For example, 3 means that we take 3 random points (of course, those point coordinates are random, but they are generated from the pre-defined seed, so each element of BRIEF descriptor is computed deterministically from the pixel rectangle), find point of maximum brightness and output index of the winner (0, 1 or 2). Such output will occupy 2 bits, and therefore it will need a special variant of Hamming distance, denoted as NORM_HAMMING2 (2 bits per bin). When WTA_K=4, we take 4 random points to compute each bin (that will also occupy 2 bits with possible values 0, 1, 2 or 3).");

ORB/ScoreType: 0 # default= 0  The default HARRIS_SCORE=0 means that Harris algorithm is used to rank features (the score is written to KeyPoint::score and is used to retain best nfeatures features); FAST_SCORE=1 is alternative value of the parameter that produces slightly less stable keypoints, but it is a little faster to compute.");

ORB/PatchSize: 31 # default= 31 size of the patch used by the oriented BRIEF descriptor. Of course, on smaller pyramid layers the perceived image area covered by a feature will be larger.");

ORB/Gpu: false # Use GPU version of ORB. This option is enabled only if OpenCV is built with CUDA and GPUs are detected.");
